# Retro USB Controller (AKA a "fight stick")

In this project, I created a box which utilizes old school arcade buttons to act as a working game controller.
The device can connect to a computer with a micro USB cable and outputs keyboard inputs to the computer.
This allows the controller to be used for any game as long as it allows you to rebind the controls.
Everything runs off of an Arduino Leonardo which allows for USB device emulation due to its ATmega32U4 microcontroller.
