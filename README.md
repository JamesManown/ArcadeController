# DIY Retro USB Controller (AKA a "fight stick")

In this project, I created a box which utilizes old school arcade buttons to act as a working game controller.
The device can connect to a computer with a micro USB cable and outputs keyboard inputs to the computer.
This allows the controller to be used for any game as long as it allows you to rebind the controls.
Everything runs off of an Arduino Leonardo which allows for USB device emulation due to its ATmega32U4 microcontroller.

The outer box was made using some wood found in the street which was cut with power tools and put together with hot glue.
The top piece is the most intricate part of the build in terms of wood working as it features the holes that the button and joystick will be put into.
This part was planned out using AutoCad 2020, and the basic design for the layout was based off of one of the designs showed on [SlagCoin.com](https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html).
